I wanted to become EDM producer. But i lost my love for listening to music. It is destroying me. How can i get it back?
The more i miss being close to someone, and the more I have resignated, the more i enjoy music as some kind of outlet
Games, movies, shows, or music doesn’t interest me anymore
I'm smoking cigarettes and drinking beer so that I have something to do with my hands. I lost interest in music which always been my passion. I spent the last 5 days browsing Youtube, alone in my flat with hardly any news from my surroundings.
Games, movies, music, nothing is exciting or holds my attention anymore
I'm just so...bored. Bored of everything. Bored of games, of my guitar, of music, of reading, of eating. Nothing is fun. I just sit around all day awaiting a motivational burst to try and get back into my old hobbies but it never comes.
Why I started to lost interest even in video games and music?
