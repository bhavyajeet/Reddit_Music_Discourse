All I want is a cute girl to hang out with, listen to music with, etc.. But I can't even have that...
TV is a waste, Video Games are a waste, Reading, Music etc, everything like that feels pointless
I want friends, but I have no interest in movies, games, books, shows, music, or literally anything but making things. It's so hard to relate.
The only time I can enjoy my life is when I'm watching anime/listening to music
I have a plethora of choices in front of me for food, books, television, music, video games, etc. And yet I want none of it.
Imagine having a house with a big garden, and a swimming pool, and owning a nice car, so you won’t lose 2 hours everyday stuck in public transportation, and everyday when you finish college, you go to your car put some music and enjoy the ride and then going to your house and have a little swim
in the last year i have accomplished nothing besides becoming addicted to porn, music, and clash of clans
Tired of living vicariously through movies &amp; music... i need a real relationship....
I’m only living for music, movies, anime, and video games.
Enjoying music is now a fucking chore
Music is the only thing that gets me through the day.
Music is the only thing I still enjoy.
Anybody else find music to be the only good part of the day?
Music is the only thing I still care about
Music is the only thing that understands me
I don't care about anything the only thing I still live for are games and music
The one thing I care about, music, is slowly becoming a joyless chore.
Music is the only thing not monotonous anymore
Music is the only thing I'm still able to enjoy
Music is literally the only thing I really enjoy now
i started talking to other people who make music and everyone only care about themselves
Music is the only thing that gives me any sense of enjoyment anymore
