found the motivation to make something today (music)
Anyone want to make music? Trying to get my mind off of things.
I'm a musician. I play beautiful music, but I can't make beautiful.
I want to shoot the computer screen when I see ads with strumming guitar, whistling music with happy ITM people? Healthy, well-built, well-raised people enjoying the fuck out of life.
Creating things like art or music or poetry helps a lot, no matter how horrible it is
Music, I want to produce music but I feel discouraged
All I want to do is make music but I can't bring myself to, I just want to play video games that I'm not enjoying.
I just wanna make music.
Anyone make music in this sub?
If I had a music or drawing talent I would be able to convert it into a piece of art.
Creating Music/Art helped me a lot, maybe you also

I desperately want to make music, but making music makes me hate myself

I made an Anime Music Video
Finally writing music I'm honest in
Still haven't practiced guitar, have been totally slacking off on music theory, everything is falling into disarray. I don't even know what type of email to send for a totally different class project.
Some music I made
Wish I could make music for a living
I started working on my music today

consider music production as a hobby.
To all people making music, art, movies and struggling with life
