Listening to an album I used to enjoy when I was 18. Music that used to make me feel good now makes me feel depressed cause it reminds me of times that never come back.
While walking with the dog I caught myself thinking about what other people, I could meet, would think about me, if they knew what music I was listening to. I was listening to Meteora by Linkin Park.
Went to a music-oriented high school's end of year recital today, felt extremely sad seeing all the teens happy and creatively working with one another, something ive never felt firsthand and can only live vicariously through envy
