Get out music
Anyone use music as an escape?
Escaping with coffee and music, every day
I want to escape to a time without worries whenever i hear music from the 20â€™s etc
Take shelter in your music
Lana Del Rey's music is my only comfort and escape.
There's no greater escape than music
Music is a good escape!
There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats.
Listening to music is my only escape.
Music is my only escape
I wanna stop using music as an escape
Music is my Escape
Not even music is an escape anymore...
Music as an escape or tool for catharsis
Music is my escape
Music as an escape
Music as a form of escape
Music as a form of escape
Why is music such a double-edge sword?
